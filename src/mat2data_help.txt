Stores matrix X to some data file named 'filename'. In case matrix X comprises column labels, these will be treated as header labels. Additionally, if matrix X comprises row labels, these will be added as a string-valued column.

The output is archived in the format as specified in 'filename'. All file-formats as supported by gretl can be chosen, e.g. csv, txt, gdt or gdtb. If no format-extension is provided, '.gdt' is added automatically.

The output file will be written in the currently set "workdir", unless "filename" contains a full path specification. If a file filename already exists at the target directory, it will be overwritten.

Note: The package only works if an data set is opened (either via the 'open' or 'nulldata' commands).

Output:		integer
Arguments:	X (matrix)
			filename (string)
Return:
Returns a zero integer on successful completion, otherwise 1.
