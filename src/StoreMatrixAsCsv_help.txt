Writes the matrix X to a csv-file named filename. In case matrix X comprises column labels, these will be treated as header column labels. If matrix X comprises row labels, these will be added as a string valued column at the first position.

If a file filenam already exists, it will be overwritten. The return value is 0 on successful completion; if an error occurs, such as the file being unwritable, the return value will be non-zero.

The output file will be written in the currently set workdir, unless the filename string contains a full path specification.

Output:		integer
Arguments:	X (matrix)
		filename (string)
		delimiter (string, either ',' or ';', default ';')
